Here’s a simplified explanation of how the packet analyzer works:

1. **Setting Up**: 
   - The program first creates a "raw socket" that lets it capture all incoming packets at the IP layer.
   - It then opens a `.pcap` file, which will store captured packets in a format readable by network analysis tools (like Wireshark).

2. **Capturing Packets**:
   - The program enters a loop where it constantly listens to incoming packets using the raw socket. Each time a packet is received, it’s saved to the `.pcap` file for later analysis.
   
3. **Decoding Ethernet Frames**:
   - Each captured packet is parsed first as an **Ethernet frame**, which contains MAC addresses for the source and destination and the type of protocol used (like IPv4 or IPv6).

4. **Interpreting IPv4 Packets**:
   - If the protocol type indicates IPv4, it then decodes more details, such as the version, header length, **TTL** (time-to-live), and the source and destination IP addresses.
   - Depending on the protocol type within the IPv4 packet (e.g., ICMP, TCP, or UDP), the program further processes the packet.

5. **Handling Protocols (ICMP, TCP, UDP)**:
   - **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets are parsed to show their type, code, and checksum.
   - **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) packets are decoded to show port numbers, sequence, acknowledgment numbers, and flags (like SYN, ACK).
     - If a packet uses port 80 (HTTP), it tries to interpret the data as HTTP content.
   - **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) packets are decoded for their source and destination ports and length.
   
6. **Saving and Displaying**:
   - The analyzer saves details about each packet and displays them in a formatted, hierarchical structure for easy reading. Any packet that isn’t recognized as IPv4 is displayed as raw Ethernet data.

7. **Closing**:
   - Once the program is stopped, it closes the `.pcap` file, making it ready for inspection by tools like Wireshark, where more advanced analysis can be done. 

This tool gives a real-time view of network traffic details, providing insights into the structure and flow of packets across the network.
